##This one is called pain never goes away, written for somebody I had loved who just wished to be happy.

-Chorus-
Time after time
It won't happen
The lies you find
Will come closer
Cause you have to run
The pain never goes away
And you need to get through the day

It's hard, the life, the love that we have to hide
It's breaking us apart
People always ask why
I don't have an answer in my mind
Lost in this fake paradise
I just wanna go and
Be alone with my dreams

- pre-Chorus -
But it's not what it is going to be
And I'll never get you free
When you're in my head
I can't let you go out of my hands

-Chorus-
Time after time
It won't happen
The lies you find
Will come closer
Cause you have to run
The pain never goes away
And you need to get through the day

Blackout, from the bottles behind my back
And I still can't get that
Kind of happiness I wish I had
It's blue and black
My second favorite after jack
Not enough to pull me back to life
I'm alone in this lie

- pre-Chorus -
Sadness is the reality
And I'll never get you free
Cause you are not yourself
I wish you knew that

-Chorus-
Time after time
It won't happen
The lies you find
Will come closer
Cause you have to run
The pain never goes away
And you need to get through the day

I hope , you just, be who you are
It shines so bright, I see through your eyes
You should not close your eyes
And hold back your tears
It's what you got, after all
You won this war

## This one is called Last words. Written for somebody who thought he loved me but actually he just wanted to replace somebody with me. Half of the last part is from ayten alpman; ben boyleyim.

You're causing me so much pain,I can't take it anymore
You're trying to hide your lies with the truths I know
I go in and out of my mind,all because you're so gone
I don't even know what to do,hit a new low
When it comes to make stories,you should not lean on me
My fancifulness doesn't depend on gravity
If i fly away,so far away,forget me,keep your heart safe
Found and lost,i tried the most,let you down with the heavy price it costs

-Chrous-
I'm sorry it had to be this way
I'm sorry i acted insane
I'm sorry i go up and down,we created this game
And we lost our ways,tried to follow different lights to go home
Only to go back where we started,we fell into fire
Now burning up inside
You're chained to half of the things you didn't say
I'm chained to my fears and the things i've never said
We're playing different characters everytime to hide from the truth
But i'm never planning to change you,even though i could

It seems like i'm not good for you
It seems like you're happier when i'm not around
It's like i'm drowning you into my problems
My love's like rollercoaster,gets you high just to come down
And hearing you say i lead you to depression just kills me
Because all i wanted to do was save your sanity
But i've lost the track what you're up to probably
So i'm setting you free

Wish i had the bravery to tell everything
But i can't change myself,that ship has sailed

-Chrous-
I'm sorry i'm not good enough for you
I'm sorry i can't make every dream of you come true
I'm sorry even though i read some signs, i can't accept it's true
But i love how fast you realize when i'm not around and miss me like i do
I love how you say secretly you're my songs
I love how you care about me when i listen your songs
But god knows why,why i can't go no more
If i don't have another half of that are left unsaid
Then there's no point of

You say you're sorry for all the things happened
You say you're sorry for all your happy years
You say our love should've been shadeles,should've been undoubted
But i can't forgive,i'm built that way
You say shoot if you want,fondle if you want
But it's you we're talking about,i can't do what i want
You say hold if you want,send out if you want
But it's you we're talking about,I can not have you out of my life
You say love if you want,force if you want
But it's you we're talking about,I can't love somebody whose heart waiting for another one
You say I'm built that way
But i'm not
I'm weak for the love,this has gone too far
Letting you know lil butterfly this is not perfect continuous,it's simple present that goes for forever
You will always have a special place in my heart
From the day you fly till i die 


---------------------------------------------------
 
## this one is called become a butterfly. written for the same person above. at this time ,  i was happy.

No need to rush ,no need to fly
No need to leave my heart before you crush
You can play in there and be safe ,don't care
I'll save you in my head,won't hear what they say

-Chorus-
Cause you,you,you help me get through
From this fake paradise but show me another life
I've become a butterfly
To love everytime

They don't affect me at all
They love me with all it costs
They come for me but I dont know how to go
I resist , I won't go away
I'm here watching you pick
They say you're happy without him,leave it that way

-Chorus-
But you,you,you help me get through
From this fake paradise to show me another life
I've become a butterfly
To love everytime


To love everytime,I fly so high
So follow your heart,I'm alright

--------------------------------------------------------

## this one is called over and over again, again same person.

I would go back in time and choose you
I would go back in time and earn you
I would go back in time and love you
Over and over again

Only if you knew
How deep my cuts run to
How deeply I love
Only if you knew
How much I have tried
To not to fall apart
To make myself the one

-Chorus-
I escaped from your ghost
To love somebody else
I felt you in my head
Thought I left you in my past
Your eyes on me again
I don't belong to your wonderland


If I was given a chance,I would change me for you
I would go back in time and hold you
Hug you,million times I swear I would
Wouldn't hurt you if I could
Would've loved you more if I had knew
If only I knew,if only I knew

-Chorus-
I escaped from your ghost
To love somebody else
I felt you in my head
Thought I left you in my past
Your eyes on me again
I don't belong to your wonderland

-----------------------------------------------------------

##this one is called you and me. the fact that he still is my friend  is weird.

Looking back to old photos saturday night
That january cold feeling in my heart
You in my arms
Holding me so tight
I fell in love with your eyes
Everything so different now
Everything is meaningless
I crushed my heart into million pieces
To forget you
To forget why I needed you
But it's impossible when you're around

-Chorus-
I tried to run away many times
I have failed
Got tired of everyting
Sat on my chair
I don't love you anymore
But why I can't forget ?
Why I'm feeling this way ?
Say to my face
What happened to me ?
Why I went to upside down
Why only I burned in the crowd
Why I'm so quiet but so loud
I can't stop this feeling
When you're talking about
Me
And it is not what you wanted to be


Sad
We're both sad
And mad
Quite Mad
Can't say anything to each other
But somehow I feel that
It is supposed to end this way
Cause we could not have loved anymore
And I'm happy
I think you're happy too
And that's the best we could do

You were my first big love
Thank you for being that
You helped me to learn what love is
Forever grateful for your existence

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## this one is called In the darkest time of the night, written for somebody you know :) at least his name :)

Dark skies, dark dreams
Dark nights without you to live
But I'm not complete
I feel you in my body
I see from your eyes
It's so different, I feel paralyzed

I froze in the darkest time of the night
I became invisible
Couldn't breathe, couldn't see, couldn't feel
I lost myself in the lies you spilled

-Chorus-
In the darkest time of the night
I'm chained to your lies
I can't fly away, you hold me so tight
But I'm chocking in the smoke
Of the traumas from your childhood
I know you can not be alone
But you kill me slowly

You kill me slowly
I'm not gonna make it

I come in, you go away
When you don't need me
I get crazy, the way you treat me
I'm not a toy from your story
You can't use me when you're sorry
If I help you, it means I need you
It means I want you here

- pre-Chorus -
But you show who you are
Everytime you play your part
You really love spotlight

-Chorus-
In the darkest time of the night
I'm chained to your sins
It goes on and on and on
I seem to pay bills
Of your chaotic mind
It sucks the last drop of my blood
It's killing me nonstop
And you don't even care honestly

You don't even care honestly
I'm not gonna make it

I fall to my knees
Eveytime you leave me for somebody
Do you know how I feel ?
When I walk alone in the dark
It's so scary when you're about to fall apart
And when it's so scary
I help you to get up
I hold you close
I know your thoughts don't leave you alone
But you still ignite
The fire that will burn me alive
If that's what you want
I hope I can run away

-Chorus-
I hope I can run away
I can't lose myself to save you from your hell
It breaks every inch of me to heal you and
Love is not made to make one happy
And to lose someone who wished to be just loved
I hope they will be loved

-----------------------------------------------------------

## this one is called follow you home.

I'll follow you home
If you let me get into
Darkness in your mind
Is what I see when I'm with you
Against to my heart
Against to my friends
I wish to be with you
No matter how this ends
Even though I lose myself
I know I'll find it in you
Int the end

Fireflies around my eyes
I lay on the ground
Touching the sky
Stars are falling

I'm alone and helpless
Running from sadness
Knowing it will catch me
But I breathe the fresh air
So I'll get faster
And jump as soon as I see the end

Now you're in home
Your fears caught you
Darkest time of the night
Your past talking to you
You're closing your ears
Pretending it isn't real
Trying to be calm
And looking for a gateaway
To see another day
Dreaming it's sunny and warm and sweet and real
It's everything you have wanted all along

I'll follow you home
If you let me get into
We'll jump off the bridge
As soon as they catch you
Maybe we'll die at the end
But it's better than to be chained to this sick world
And sick people
They never believe you
And makes you feel like
You are not real

I'm in the dark waiting for you
You know when I'll run
Keep your eyes on me when it's blue


------------------------------------------------------------------

## this one does not have name cause i wrote this, this monday in likeeee 6 minutes. not written for somebody special.
intro

Let me take you to the moon
Fairytale of our love
The only one that cant be replaced 
In our hearts

Me and you on sunset
The winds go high and we fly away
I've never been this relieved 
The sky has never been this pretty
Oh oh Oh ×3

I'm drowning in you
my sadness goes away
Calm and warm feeling 
Thanks to you 
But sometimes i cant understand
The way i love makes you go again
And that's when i breathe in the sea
The blue and blue in me
Oh oh Oh × 4

And you have me in your hands 
Playing with my sanity 
And i cant resist to your games
That's the only time youre happy

So ı'm only drowning in you
Cause i cant face my demons too 
The blue and blue
If i only knew
How to love better 
Cause i need to

------------------------------------------------------

## this one does not have a name too.

I dont want to write about you
Everytime i do , i swear it's last
You're my past, you're my last
Seems like i can not love anyone 
And I cant get you off of my mind
Even though you left me behind

It's your picture pops in my head
When i hear the melody 
When i fall in to the ocean 
Self devotion, in the deepest blue
The only place i feel you 
I breathe in the water
It doesnt matter
Cause the oxygen is not anything better

I, am not, better off , alone
Cause i dream about you
I, think every night , in the blind moments
How you caught me off my guard
And I , cant stop , the way i love you
I need to ,be with you, even though
You're my foe

And your photos still hangs on my wall 
Anytime I want to see your face 
To remind me i was in pain
But smiled anyway 
The roads, only place i know that makes me love you more 
Cause that's only time I trust you 

That's only time you're honest
Only time yourself
Only time i feel you're so broken 
But you still let me slip away 

And it's been 7 months
I couldn't love anyone 
I relived every moment 
I listened natural
-------------------------------------------------------------

## being the drama queen I have always been
 
I cant cry anymore
I cant think of it all
Sadness and sleeples nights
Thoughts running through my mind 
I cant even pick a one 
I'm so tired of it all
Madness , dont know where it comes
Any time I hear your talk
I push myself till you bleed out

And im not what you made me to be
I'm just a victim of your lies

Now when i look at the mirror
I cant even see myself here
Put up with all the bullshit
Gone and never come back
All the things i wished upon you
Haunted me in the nights not just you 
Demons of you 
Let me be without you

-----------------------------------------------------------------

intro of something 

Looking at the moonlight , ocean is quite
Your arms wrapped around my waist
The feeling of peace
The vision i see
It's all i have waited for

This summer belongs to you 
This summer something brand new
This summer is the time to figure me out

Running from the old loves
Reaching to your heart 
You know i'm a butterfly
Fly for love to be alive
It's so short but it's heavy
They did try to keep me
Put the chains of jealousy
But you let me be free
But you let me be me

---------------------------------------------------------------
all of these are small part of my ...
